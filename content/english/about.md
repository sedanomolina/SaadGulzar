I work closely with politicians, political parties, bureaucrats, and government agencies to show that those not considered traditionally elite are in fact equally, if not more, capable of competent governance. I demonstrate that incorporating non-elite – and therefore, more representative – voices in government robustly improves policy.

Before joining Princeton, I was an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Stanford University. I received my Ph.D. in Politics at New York University in 2017. My work has received the Best Dissertation Award from American Political Science Association’s Experiments Section, as well as the Lawrence Longley Award for best article published on Representation & Electoral Systems in 2020, and the Paul A. Sabatier Award for best conference paper on Science, Technology, & Environmental Politics in 2020. My Google Scholar profile is
